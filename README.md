# Defect-evolution-of-HEA
Documents the defect evolution of HEAs

Animation of all simulation runs are shown in this project. 
Animations were processed through Common Neighbor Analysis(CNA) and a self-developed defect classifying algorithm via OVITO. In CNA processed videos, atoms with fcc crystal structure is colored green, bcc crystal structure is colored blue and hcp crystal structure is colored red. Amorphous atoms are excluded in all videos.
Each animation is recorded till the model rupture or amorphous tip nucleated.
